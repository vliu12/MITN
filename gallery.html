        <p class="about">Music in the Neighbourhood has held two successful events in the past, one in September of 2022 and one in December of 2022. Both concerts were held at the North Delta Center for the Arts, and lasted around two hours from start to finish. Each event featured approximately 20 performers, 10 volunteers, and 100 attendees. The volunteers were local youth from Seaquam and Burnsview Secondary, and performed tasks such as set up, donation forms, and clean up. Over two concerts, we raised $3033 dollars towards the “Balding for Dollars” charity, which was over $1000 more than our initial goal of $2000.
