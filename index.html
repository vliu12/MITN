  <h2 class="about">About</h2>
  <p class="p1"><em>Music in the Neighbourhood is a non-profit organization pioneered by Victoria Liu and Julianne Yu. We are a charity music concert based out of North Delta and performed by the children and youth of the Delta and Lower Mainland community. We feature a variety of instruments, including the piano, violin, viola, and harp. Our concert is non-profit; however, we ask for donations through our audience. All of our proceeds go towards the “Balding for Dollars” charity, which runs in partnership with the BC Children’s Hospital Foundation. Its funding is dedicated solely to the oncology department of BCCH to help kids and their families fight cancer. 
  <br><br>For the last three years, social events such as this have been put on hold due to the pandemic. As a result, communities have become disconnected and isolated, which is far from what a true community should be. Our event serves as a way to reignite this communal spirit while also supporting a great cause. Not only do the performers get to connect with youth playing instruments other than their own, but the audience is also able to be immersed in a space with a variety of musical talents and sounds. Music in the Neighbourhood also gives local youth a platform to perform and showcase their hard work in a real stage setting. This is a wonderful opportunity for the community and the kids alike after these past three years, during which most concerts were held online.
