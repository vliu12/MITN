  <h2 class="about">About</h2>
  <p class="p1"><em>Music in the Neighbourhood is a charity event organized by Victoria Liu, Julianne Yu, and their parents. It is a music concert based out of North Delta that is performed by the children and youth (ages 5-16) of the Delta and Lower Mainland community. We feature a variety of instruments, including the piano, violin, viola, and harp. Our concert is non-profit; however, we ask for donations through our audience. All of our proceeds go towards the “Balding for Dollars” charity, which runs in partnership with the BC Children’s Hospital Foundation. Its funding is dedicated solely to the oncology department of BCCH to help kids and their families fight cancer.
